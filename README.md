## 🎓 About This Project

This project was built during my internship to gain hands-on experience with backend development in Laravel. I implemented everything manually — including cart and search features — to really understand the logic behind each part. It’s now a complete backend for an eCommerce platform with real-world features, fully integrated with APIs and ready to scale.
